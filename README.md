# SQL_kickstarter
Searching for patterns in failed campaigns.

Data used in this project are avaliable here:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects.
Here are some infromation about columns that I used in code:
* ID: Kickstarter project ID
* name: Name of project
* category: Category of project
* main_category: Main category of project
* goal: Fundraising goal
* pledged: Amount pledged
* state: State of project (successful, canceled, etc.)
* backers: Number of project backers

The aim of this project is to get data and information that can help answer following questions:
1. What types of projects are most likely to be successful?
2. Which projects fail?
  
In this project I wrote SQL statements to learn about the schema of my database and data types in table.
I used the SELECT statement to retrieve and create columns of interest.
I used the WHERE statement to retrieve records meeting a variety of categorical and quantitative conditions.
I used the ORDER BY statement to sort your query results by one or more fields.
I used CASE statements to apply conditional logic to your query results.
